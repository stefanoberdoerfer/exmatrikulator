This directory contains the files which got used by OpenSores in our development
environment. If you want to change the environment of the Exmatriklator to
development, follow these steps:

1. Copy the pom.xml of this directory to the pom.xml of the main directory and
   override the existing pom.xml.
2. Copy the persistence.xml of this directory to the directory
   src/main/resources/META-INF/ and override the existing persistence.xml
3. Copy the file ApplicationController.java of this directory to the directory
   /src/main/java/de/unibremen/opensores/controller/common/
   and override the existing file.

You can build the .war from the source code and run the embedded-glassfish
plugin with the command in the main directory.

	$ mvn clean package embedded-glassfish:run

This creates a .war archive for the Exmatrikulator application and
starts the embedded glassfish server. If you didn't see any errors
the webapp should be running at: http://0.0.0.0:8080/exmatrikulator/

If you want to change the files back to the production environment after you've
already changed these files, then follow the stepts of the README in the directory
/prod-environment/
