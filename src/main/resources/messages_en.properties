  For example, this grading formula would give every student of the selected participation \
  type the grade 1.3:
formula.guide.one_three_formula=def set_final_grade(grades, student_info, other_course_grades)\:\n\
  \treturn PaboGrade.GRADE_1_3
gradingFormula.linkToGuide=A short instruction for the implementation can be found here.
formula.guide.parametersTitle=The three parameters of the grade formula
formula.guide.parametersIntro=In the grade formula the three parameters \
<tt>grades</tt>, <tt>student_info</tt> and \
<tt>other_course_grades</tt> can be used to calculate the final grade of each student. \
These parameters contain the data of one single student and get set internally\
by Exmatrikulator. \
All three parameters are \
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries">python dictionaries</a>\
which map key values to target values.
formula.guide.parameterGradesTitle=The parameter grades
formula.guide.parameterGradesText=This parameter contains all grades of a student \
  in the current course. The unique identifier of each exam is used as key in the \
  dictionary, and the achieved grade of the student in the exam is returned as target value. \
  If you want to get the grade of the exam <tt>klausur</tt> then simply call <tt>grades[\'klausur\']</tt>. \
  The grades are represented differently in the dictionary, depending on their grade type. \
<ul>\
    <li><tt>Grade</tt> Numeric Grades get saved as \
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html">Decimal objects</a> \
        , which can hold any number of floating points and can do basic arithmetic \
        operations. For example, the grade 3.14159265359 gets saved as <tt>Decimal(\'3.14159265359\')</tt>. \
    </li>\
    <li><tt>Percent</tt> Percent values get saved like numeric grades as <tt>Decimal</tt>. \
        A percent value of von 23.78% gets saved as <tt>Decimal(\'23,78\')</tt>. \
    </li>\
     <li>\
         <tt>Passed / Not passed</tt>: Exams, which can only be passed or not passed \
         get saved as Boolean values. \
         A passed exam gets the value <tt>True</tt>, a not passed exam the value <tt>False</tt>. \
     </li>\
        <tt>Points</tt>: Exams which have a maximum number of achievable points get saved as \
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences">Tuple</a> \
        of two <tt>Decimals</tt>. \
        The first element is the amount of achieved points of the student, the second element is \
        the maximum amount of achievable points. \
     </li>\
 </ul>\
  If a student has got no grade in an exam, the exam will have the value <tt>None</tt> instead of the previously \
  described values.
formula.guide.parameterStudentInfoTitle=The parameter student_info
formula.guide.parameterStudentInfoText=\
  This parameter contains information about the student, which grades are currently used \
  in the function. The data of the students is also accessible via string keys in the dictionary. \
  E.g. calling <tt>student_info[\'email\']</tt> returns the email-address of the current student. \
  If some data of the student is missing then the value <tt>None</tt> is returned \
  for the corresponding key value. The following key values are available in this dictionary: \
  <ul>\
      <li><tt>first_name</tt>: The first name of the student.</li>\
      <li><tt>last_name</tt>: The last name of the student.</li>\
      <li><tt>email</tt>: The email of the student.</li>\
      <li><tt>matriculation</tt>: The matriculation number of the student.</li>\
      <li><tt>part_type</tt>: The participation type of the student.</li>\
  </ul>
formula.guide.parameterOtherCourseGradesTitle=The parameter other_course_grades
formula.guide.parameterOtherCourseGradesText=\
  This parameter contains the grades of courses, in which the currently logged in user (It's you!) \
  is a lecturer and the student, with which the current grade formula is called, \
  is also participating in. \
  In this way you can use grades of the student from your other/older courses. \
  This dictionary firstly contains a keyset of all semesters, in which the previously described common courses \
  of the student and the lecturer are found. \
  Bear in mind that different students may have a different set of semesters in this dictionary \
  and the dictionary can also be empty, if the student doesn't participate in any common \
  course with the currently logged in user as lecturer. \
  So the semester names are used as the first key values for the dictionary, \
  which returns a new dictionary containing a keyset of the unique identifiers of all found courses in the semester. \
  These unique course identifiers point to the last dictionary of the grades, \
  which is structured exactly like the first parameter <tt>grades</tt>.
settings.formulaLoading=The page of the grade formula is loading. \
This can take a few moments.
