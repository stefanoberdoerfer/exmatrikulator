Exmatrikulator Capybara
=======================

Frontend tests for Exmatrikulator with capybara.

Installation
------------

You need ruby 1.9.3 (or higher) and rubygems in order to run the tests.

Furthermore, bundler is required to install the dependencies. If you
setup ruby and rubygems properly you should be able to install bundler
by invoking the following command:

	# gem install bundler

If you don't want to install it globally pass the `--user-install` flag,
otherwise you will need to run it as root. Afterwards you can install
capybara and other dependencies for the tests using:

	$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle

Keep in mind that some of our dependencies depend on C libraries and
software like xvfb and qt-webkit so make sure you have those installed
as well.

Usage
-----

To run the tests using webkit on a 'fake' framebuffer X server invoke:

	$  xvfb-run -a bundle exec ruby run_tests.rb

The `run_tests.rb` uses a dirty hack to start the embedded glassfish
server using `mvn` it also removes the `exmatrikulator-db` to drop the
database.
