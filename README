Exmatrikulator
==============

Making it 20% easier to get rid of your students.

Download
--------

Checkout the source code using:

	$ git clone git@gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de:OpenSores/exmatrikulator-code.git

Usage
-----

Before starting the Java EE container itself you need to compile all
SASS files to CSS and all CofeeScript files to JavaScript. To do that
take a look at the `README` in the `src/main/gui` directory. If you skip
this step the frontend will look ugly.

Apache maven is used as the build system. A few plugins are shipped to
make it easier to perform various common tasks. One of these plugins is
the embedded glassfish plugin, this plugin makes it easy to get a
development setup up and running by invoking:

	$ mvn package embedded-glassfish:run

This creates a .war archive for the Exmatrikulator application and
starts the embedded glassfish server. If you didn't see any errors
the webapp should be running at: http://0.0.0.0:8080/exmatrikulator/

Tests
-----

Tests are automatically run using GitLab CI. Basically we have three
kinds of tests:

1. JUnit backend tests
2. Formal code verification
3. Capybara frontend tests

The first are automatically invoked by the GitLab CI runner, the last
was doesn't work properly on a GitLab CI runner and needs to be run
manually. Instructions for running the capybara test suite are available
in `src/test/capybara`.
