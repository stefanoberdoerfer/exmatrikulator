Exmatrikulator
==============

Making it 20% easier to get rid of your students.

Usage in production mode
----
The Exmatrikulator is setup for production mode as it got shipped by OpenSores
on the 4th March 2016. You can run the Exmatrikulator in production mode by
following the detailed instructions in the manual which got included in the release.

If you have changed the environment to development environment by following the
steps described in `Usage in development mode`, than you can restore the
production environment by copying the files of the directory `prod-environment`
to their respective directories in `src/`. You can read more detailed instructions
for copying these files in the `README` file of the directory `prod-environment`.

Usage in development mode
----
By default the mode of the source code is for production mode.
If you want to further develop the Exmatrikulator, you can set up the development
environment by copying the persistence.xml, pom.xml and the file
ApplicationController.java from the directory 'prod-environment' to their
respective places in the 'src/' directory and rebuilding the .war.
More detailed instructions for copying these files are in the 'README' file of
the directory 'prod-environment'.

The Maven plugin embedded glassfish is used as development server instead of the
normal glassfish server. After you've replaced the files you can build the
.war and start the embedded glassfish server with this command.

	$ mvn package embedded-glassfish:run

This creates a .war archive for the Exmatrikulator application and starts the
embedded glassfish server. If you didn't see any errors the webapp should be
running at: http://0.0.0.0:8080/exmatrikulator/

In the development environment, the database which is supplied by glassfish
as resource, gets used for the database connection. This database gets dropped
and recreated and filled with dummy data after every deployment.
The method 'initDummyData()' of the class 'ApplicationController' in the path
/src/main/java/de/unibremen/opensores/controller/common/ApplicationController.java
gets used to insert the dummy data in the database for every deployment. By
default, there are three users and one course inserted as dummy data. The users
and their credentials are:
 * A normal User which is a student: login: user@uni-bremen.de, pw: 'user'
 * A lecturer in a course: lecturer@uni-bremen.de, pw: 'lecturer'
 * An admin: admin@uni-bremen.de, pw: 'admin'


Changing the CSS or Javascript files in `src/main/webapp/resources`
----
The Javascript and CSS files got compiled from the CoffeeScript and SASS files
located in the directory `src/main/gui`. If you want to edit the CSS or
Javascript files, edit and recompile the respective CoffeeScript and SASS files.
Take a look at the `README` in the `src/main/gui` directory for more information
about compiling these files.


Tests
-----

Basically we have three kinds of tests:

1. JUnit backend tests
2. Formal code verification
3. Capybara frontend tests

The first are automatically invoked by Maven, the second tests got used
in our gitlab CI runner and the the last one needs to be invoked manually.
Instructions for running the capybara test suite are available
in `src/test/capybara`.
