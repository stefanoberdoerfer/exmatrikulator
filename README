Exmatrikulator
==============

Making it 20% easier to get rid of your students.

Download
--------

Checkout the source code using:

	$ git clone git@gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de:OpenSores/exmatrikulator-code.git

Usage
-----

Apache maven is used as the build system. A few plugins are shipped to
make it easier to perform various common tasks. One of these plugins is
the embedded glassfish plugin, this plugin makes it easy to get a
development setup up and running by invoking:

	$ mvn package embedded-glassfish:run

This creates a .war archive for the Exmatrikulator application and
starts the embedded glassfish server. If you didn't see any errors
the webapp should be running at: http://0.0.0.0:8080/exmartikulator/
