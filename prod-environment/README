This directory contains the files which are used in the production environment
of the Exmatrikulator. These files are the same files that are used in the first
release of Exmatrikulator by OpenSores. If you've changed the following files
by going through the steps explained in /dev-environment/README ,
you can change them back to their production
environment versions by following these steps.

1. Copy the pom.xml of this directory to the pom.xml of the main directory and
   override the existing one.
2. Copy the persistence.xml of this directory to the directory
   src/main/resources/META-INF/ and override the existing persistence.xml
3. Copy the file ApplicationController.java of this directory to the directory
   /src/main/java/de/unibremen/opensores/controller/common/
   and override the existing file.

You can build the new .war with the following command in the main directory:
   $ mvn clean package

If there were no errors while building the .war, you can now use the new .war
in the normal glassfish server like explained in the manual.
